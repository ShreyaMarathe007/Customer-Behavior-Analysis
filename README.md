## **🛍️ Customer Behavior Analysis**

## 🌟 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer shopping behavior to uncover how gender, age, season, and subscription status influence purchase trends and loyalty.  
Starting with raw data from Kaggle, the dataset was cleaned, enriched with new features, and loaded into SQL for structured analysis.  
Further insights were drawn through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and an interactive Power BI dashboard was designed to visualize key business metrics.
